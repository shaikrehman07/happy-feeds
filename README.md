# Happy-feeds
## Best viewed in web browser as the site is not totally responsive

## React and AWS (Spring Boot)

### Functionalities
1. Login and Sign up via AWS Cognito and the tokens are valid for 1 day only and again you need to sign in.
2. View and change profile picture as you wish with scaling of user photo.
3. Create posts with your photo and add caption to it.
4. Search other users using email and see their profiles.
5. You can send friend request to other users and receive from them.
6. You can view friend request sent and received by clicking notification icon.
7. You can view your uploaded photos and friends list by clicking profile icon.
8. All the backend endpoints are protected via jwt tokens.

I hope you have good experience while using my happy-feeds.
